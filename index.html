<p>Development and optimization of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for classifying a 3-dimensional real-valued random vector into one of four classes with uniform priors. The main objective is to effectively approximate class label posteriors and to implement a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) classification rule using the trained MLPs, achieving the lowest possible probability of error.</p>
<p>The MLPs are trained using maximum likelihood parameter estimation, minimizing the average cross-entropy loss and enabling precise approximation of the class label posteriors. Post-training, the MLPs are utilized to implement a MAP classification rule aimed at minimizing the expected loss, using a binary loss function for correct and incorrect classification.</p>
<p>The optimization process includes one hidden layer of perceptrons, with the optimal number of neurons determined via K-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV. These methods are used to fine-tune the number of perceptrons and regularization, ensuring the model is appropriately scaled to the dataset size and complexity.</p>
